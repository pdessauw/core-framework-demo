# Core Framework Demo

## Description

A demonstration of the behavior of the Core Framework built on top of Django. To provide the most complete example, we
are putting on the repository:
    * Two Django projects, each containing:
        * Their own web theme (available on [https://getbootstrap.com]),
        * Configuration and installation files.
    * Three different apps (including the core app), including:
        * Models,
        * APIs for the models,
        * Views.

## Disclaimer

This repository is a proof of concept for an ongoing set of projects related to Django. Feel free to use the ideas you
find inside it in your own projects.
